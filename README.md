# E-Commerce - Microservice

This repository contains the code for an e-commerce application built with Node.js using microservices architecture.

## Getting Started

To get started with the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/e-commerce-microservice.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the microservices: `npm run start:services`
4. Start the main application: `npm start`

## Architecture

The application follows a microservices architecture, where different components of the e-commerce system are decoupled and run as independent services. The main components include:

- **Product Service**: Manages the products available for sale.
- **Order Service**: Handles the creation and management of orders.
- **User Service**: Handles user authentication and authorization.
- **Payment Service**: Integrates with payment gateways for processing payments.
- **Cart Service**: Manages the user's shopping cart.

Each service is responsible for its own domain and communicates with other services through APIs or message queues.
